# Population-Clustering
Analyzing Population Data to Identify Housing Patterns Using Multidimensional Clustering and the K-means Algorithm

## Project Description
In this project, we analyze a population dataset from a specific city to identify different patterns among residents based on various variables such as annual income, age, education, and marital status. The goal is to use the K-means algorithm to divide the population into homogeneous groups, making it easier for researchers and decision-makers to understand housing patterns and make appropriate decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of multiple variables, including:
- age
- workclass
- fnlwgt
- education
- education.num
- marital.status
- occupation
- relationship
- race
- sex
- capital.gain
- capital.loss
- hours.per.week
- native.country
- income

## Steps of the Project

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyze the data to understand the variables and their distribution and to discover any missing or abnormal values.
- Use graphs and statistical tools to visualize the data.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize the variables if necessary.

### 3. Implement Clustering Using K-means
- Apply the K-means algorithm to the dataset to determine the clusters.
- Test different values of k and use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal value.

### 4. Analyze Results
- Analyze the resulting clusters and interpret the discovered patterns.
- Plot the data in two or three dimensions to visualize the results.

### 5. Present Recommendations
- Provide a comprehensive report that outlines the results and recommendations based on the discovered patterns.
- Display the results using graphs and charts.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/emadof85/Population-Clustering.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Population-Clustering
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook population_multidimensional_clustering.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis and visualization.

## Results
- The results of the K-means clustering are visualized in both 2D and 3D plots.
- The clusters are analyzed to interpret the patterns discovered among the population data.
